    <h1>Js Fundamentals</h1>

    <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brandon Ike at Netscape
    as a scripting language in Netscape Navigator 2. Originally,
    the language was called LiveScript. Syntax formation was
    influenced by C and Java, and since Java was very popular
    at the time, LiveScript was renamed JavaScript in 1995.</p>
